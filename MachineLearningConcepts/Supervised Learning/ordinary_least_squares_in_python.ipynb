    "# Ordinary Least Squares in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression, also called Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) Regression, is probably the most commonly used technique in Statistical Learning. It is also the oldest, dating back to the eighteenth century and the work of [Carl Friedrich Gauss](http://en.wikipedia.org/Carl_Freidrich_Gauss) and [Adrien-Marie Legendre](http://en.wikipedia.org/Adrien-Marie_Legendre). It is also one of the easier and more intuitive techniques to understand, and it provides a good basis for learning more advanced concepts and techniques. This posting explains how to perform linear regression using the [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/) Python package, we will discuss the single variable case and defer multiple regression to a future post.\n"

    "Statsmodel is a Python library designed for more statistically-oriented approaches to data analysis, with an emphasis on econometric analyses. It integrates well with the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) and [numpy](http://numpy.org) libraries we covered in a previous post. It also has built in support for many of the statistical tests to check the quality of the fit and a dedicated set of plotting functions to visualize and diagnose the fit. [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) also has support for linear regression, including many forms of regularized regression lacking in statsmodels, but it lacks the rich set of statistical tests and diagnostics that have been developed for linear models."

    "Linear regression one of the simplest and most commonly used modeling techniques. It makes very strong assumptions about the relationship between the predictor variables (the X) and the response (the Y). It assumes that this relationship takes the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 * x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least Squares is the simplest and most common estimator in which the two $\\beta$s are chosen to minimize the square of the distance between the predicted values and the actual values. Even though this model is quite rigid and often does not reflect the true relationship, this still remains a popular approach for several reasons. For one, it is computationally cheap to calculate the coefficients. It is also easier to interpret than more sophisticated models, and in situations where the goal is understanding a simple model in detail, rather than estimating the response well, they can provide insight into what the model captures. Finally, in situations where there is a lot of noise, it may be hard to find the true functional form, so a constrained model can perform quite well compared to a complex model which is more affected by noise.\n",
